## 🔨 What's Left (Quick Tasks)

### To Complete All 5 Calculators (~2 hours)

Just copy the pattern from `CompoundInterestScreen.tsx` or `LoansScreen.tsx`:

**1. Fixed Deposit Screen** (30 mins)
```typescript
// Create: src/screens/FixedDepositScreen.tsx
// Import: calculateFixedDeposit from services
// Inputs: depositAmount, rate, tenure, payoutType
// Outputs: maturityValue, totalInterest, periodicPayout
```

**2. Treasury Bills Screen** (30 mins)
```typescript
// Create: src/screens/TreasuryBillsScreen.tsx
// Import: calculateTreasuryBills from services
// Inputs: investmentAmount, maturityPeriod, rate
// Outputs: discountedPrice, profit, effectiveYield
```

**3. Retirement Planner Screen** (30 mins)
```typescript
// Create: src/screens/RetirementPlannerScreen.tsx
// Import: calculateRetirementPlanner from services
// Inputs: ages, balance, contribution, return, inflation
// Outputs: nominal/real corpus, yearly projection
```

**4. Update Navigation** (15 mins)
```typescript
// Add to: src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx
import { FixedDepositScreen } from '../screens/FixedDepositScreen';
import { TreasuryBillsScreen } from '../screens/TreasuryBillsScreen';
import { RetirementPlannerScreen } from '../screens/RetirementPlannerScreen';

// Add Stack.Screen for each
```

## 📊 Formula Reference

All formulas are accurate and production-ready:

**Compound Interest:**
```
A = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t) + Σ contributions with compounding
```

**Fixed Deposit:**
```
Cumulative: M = P * (1 + r/m)^(m*t)
Periodic: Interest = P * r / p
```

**Treasury Bills:**
```
Price = FaceValue / (1 + (r * d / 365))
Yield = ((FaceValue - Price) / Price) * (365 / d) * 100
```

**Loan EMI:**
```
EMI = (P * r * (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)
```

**Retirement:**
```
FV = CB * (1 + r)^t + PMT * ((1 + r)^t - 1) / r
Real = Nominal / (1 + inflation)^t
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**App won't start?**
```bash
npm start -- --clear
```

**Can't see the app on your phone?**
