## Step 1: Configure EAS Build

### 1.1 Initialize EAS
```powershell
# Navigate to your project
cd C:\Users\jAiLbReAk\Documents\Projects\finance-calculator

# Configure EAS (if not already done)
eas build:configure
```

### 1.2 Verify Configuration
Check that `eas.json` is properly configured (already done):
```json
{
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk",
        "gradleCommand": ":app:assembleRelease"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "app-bundle",
        "enableProguardInReleaseBuilds": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**üîí Code Obfuscation Enabled:**
- ‚úÖ ProGuard/R8 configured for code shrinking
- ‚úÖ Resource shrinking enabled
- ‚úÖ Debug logging removed in release builds
- ‚úÖ Expected APK/AAB size reduction: 30-40%

See [OBFUSCATION.md](./OBFUSCATION.md) for details.
```

---

## Step 2: Update App Configuration

### 2.1 Review app.json
Ensure all fields are correct:
- ‚úÖ `version`: "1.1.0"
- ‚úÖ `versionCode`: 2
- ‚úÖ `package`: "com.financecalculator.app"
- ‚úÖ `permissions`: Minimal permissions set
- ‚úÖ `blockedPermissions`: Unnecessary permissions blocked

### 2.2 Update Privacy Policy URL
In `app.json`, update the privacy policy URL in `extra` section:
```json
"extra": {
  "privacyPolicyUrl": "https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/finance-calculator/blob/main/PRIVACY_POLICY.md"
}
```

Replace `YOURUSERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 3: Build APK for Testing

### 3.1 Build Preview APK
```powershell
# Build a preview APK for testing
npm run build:android:preview

# OR directly with EAS
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

This creates an APK you can install on physical devices for testing.

### 3.2 Download and Test APK

- Invite testers via email
- Get feedback before public release

### 8.3 Open Testing
- Anyone can join
- Public testing phase
- Last step before production

### 8.4 Promote to Production
Once testing is complete:
1. Go to testing track with approved build
2. Click "Promote release"
3. Select "Production"
4. Confirm promotion

---

## Step 9: After Submission

### 9.1 Review Process
- Google reviews your app (usually 1-3 days)
- You'll receive email when approved/rejected

## Step 10: Future Updates

### 10.1 Version Updates
When releasing updates:

1. Update version in `app.json`:
   ```json
   "version": "1.2.0",
   "android": {
     "versionCode": 3
   }
   ```

2. Build new version:
   ```powershell
   npm run build:android:production
   ```

3. Submit to Google Play:
   ```powershell
   npm run submit:android
   ```

### 10.2 Version Code Rules
- Increment `versionCode` with every release
- Update `version` following semantic versioning:
  - Major: Breaking changes (2.0.0)
  - Minor: New features (1.2.0)
  - Patch: Bug fixes (1.1.1)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
```powershell
# Clear EAS cache
eas build --platform android --profile production --clear-cache

# Check build logs in EAS dashboard
# Common issues: Dependencies, gradle config, permissions
```

### Upload Fails
- Ensure `versionCode` is higher than previous release
- Check package name matches Play Console
- Verify app bundle is signed correctly

### Review Rejection
Common reasons:
- Missing privacy policy
- Incorrect permissions
- Content policy violations
- Misleading screenshots

Fix issues and resubmit.
