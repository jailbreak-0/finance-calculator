## üéØ Quick Calculator Tips

### Compound Interest
- Higher compounding frequency = more growth
- Small increases in contribution make big differences over time
- Time is your biggest ally - start early!

### Loans
- Shorter loan periods = less total interest
- Even 0.5% interest rate difference matters
- Pay extra principal to save thousands

### Retirement
- Start now, not later
- Account for inflation - it erodes purchasing power
- The real (inflation-adjusted) value matters most
