# Code Obfuscation - Quick Reference Card

## ✅ Status: ENABLED

---

## 📋 What's Configured

| Component | Status | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| ProGuard Rules | ✅ Created | Define what to keep/obfuscate |
| Expo Plugin | ✅ Installed | Auto-configure builds |
| EAS Hook | ✅ Added | Validate before build |
| Release Config | ✅ Enabled | Use obfuscation in production |

---

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
# Preview build with obfuscation
npm run build:android:preview

# Production build with obfuscation
npm run build:android:production

# Check if plugin is loaded
npx expo config --type introspect
```

## 📊 Expected Results

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| APK Size | 40-50 MB | 25-35 MB | -30-40% |
| AAB Size | 35-45 MB | 20-30 MB | -30-40% |
| Build Time | 10-15 min | 12-20 min | +2-5 min |
| Code Readable | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | 🔒 Secured |

---

## 🔍 Verify Obfuscation

### 1. Check Size
```bash
# After build completes, check download size
# Should be 30-40% smaller
```

### 2. Decompile APK
```bash
# Use jadx or apktool
jadx-gui your-app.apk

# Look for:
# - Classes: a.class, b.class, c.class ✅
# - Methods: a(), b(), c() ✅
# - No console.log() statements ✅
```

### 3. Download Mapping
```
EAS Dashboard → Build Details → Artifacts → mapping.txt
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
eas build --platform android --profile production --clear-cache
```

### App Crashes
1. Check ProGuard rules in `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`
2. Add keep rule for crashing class
3. Rebuild and test

### Feature Not Working
Add to `proguard-rules.pro`:
```proguard
-keep class com.yourpackage.FailingClass { *; }
```
